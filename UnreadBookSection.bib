abstract="A resonant optical excitation creates an excited state population and also induces an optical polarization. Dynamics of this optical excitation is characterized by relaxation of the population as well as decay of the induced optical polarization. In lower dimensional semiconductors, electronic confinement leads to qualitative changes in population relaxation, including spontaneous emission and exciton-phonon scattering, as shown in extensive recent studies [1]. These population relaxation processes are expected to contribute to dephasing with a dephasing rate given by half the population decay rate. Pure dephasing processes that do not involve population or energy relaxation of excitons can also contribute to dephasing. Pure dephasing, which is a well-established concept for atomic systems, remains yet to be investigated in lower-dimensional semiconductors due to a lack of direct comparison between dephasing and population relaxation and between theory and experiment. Studies of pure dephasing processes in lower-dimensional semiconductors will renew and deepen our understanding of dephasing of collective excitations in solids, although several seminal studies were done on the exciton dephasing in quantum well (QW) structures [2--6].",
